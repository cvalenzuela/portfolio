Hyper-realism, animations, 3D, and all forms of graphics imagery you can imagine will be at everyone's fingertips. Weta and ILM capabilities for everyone. Under this new set of rules, limitations will be a) ideas and taste: give someone who hasn't exercised their creativity in a while the most powerful model imaginable, and they will stare in silence for minutes and come up with the most unimaginative and obvious thing. Give the same model to an artist with good taste, and they will make things you can't stop looking at, and b) control: the tradeoff models will be giving in the short term will be pixel-level control, which traditional CGI tools do really well.
