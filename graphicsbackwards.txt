It took decades to establish the right abstractions - curves, triangles, polygons, meshes - that would allow us to draw exactly what we wanted on a screen. These fundamental building blocks haven't changed much because they proved to be the right ones.

A cube modeled in 1987 using the first version of Renderman follows the same geometric principles as one modeled in Blender today. What's dramatically different is the rendering - the lighting, materials, shadows, and reflections that make it feel real. The industry spent decades closing the uncanny valley, building increasingly sophisticated rendering systems to approach photorealism. Of course, many graphics innovations improved both control and quality simultaneously, and the history of graphics progress is more complex than just \"control then quality.\"",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"But this order wasn't arbitrary.
