I have noticed a tendency to oversimplify the creative act. In a research setting, the goal is to control and measure variables, which leads to the assignment of constants for things that you can't measure. This logic swiftly leads to the interpretation of a \"new algorithm for image generation\" as a means to \"be more creative.\" Attempting to standardize creativity as making pretty pictures simplifies the creative process to a convenient conclusion, which is why many AI tools seem designed more for engineers than for artists. It’s formulaic art. Creativity cannot be condensed into a formula for optimization.
