They’re critics/people/artists responding to impressionist exhibitions in the late nineteenth century.",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"When we imagine anarchy in art we picture paintings of revolutions, barricades, and raised fists. But rebels are rarely the people who depict rebellion. Rebels are the ones making work without permission, without caring for the institution’s structure, its rewards, its categories, its official conventions. Painting waterlilies, badly, by the standards of the time, might be one of the most rebellious and consequential moves in modern art history. Impressionists were depicting raw light and with that, breaking the terms of what counted as art and culture in the first place.",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"The trope of history repeating itself is a bit boring by now. But there's a reason why I keep coming back to the impressionists when people talk about AI. They staged the first truly modern art rebellion, and their rebellion helps frame the tension we're living through now. The fight is not between artists and machines. It's between rebels and the systems that convert art, media and entertainment into something safe. Something with no creative risk",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"[Side note: maybe a topic for another essay, but I think we're seeing a similar trend in software, which explains the meltdown we are seeing in the public market. tl;dr: markets have started to realize that making it hard to switch CRMs is not a defensible strategy. Tradition might not matter. You have to take risks]",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"The media we consume today is in a bad state. Sequels, reboots, remakes, \"content universes\" with carefully managed lore. How we got here has less to do with human creativity and more to do with structural and financial incentives that have no face. Mr. Market. Most films, TV shows, games, and content go through approvals, notes, test screenings, brand fit, stakeholder reviews. Since it’s expensive to make, the incentive is predictable risk.",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"We blame “the audience” for wanting comfort, but audiences don’t design production pipelines or approve budgets.

Why not.",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"It is becoming cheap to make anything. Cheapness changes incentives.

The tool that can widen your imagination can also narrow culture.",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"A second common trope is that AI “democratizes creativity,” and in a narrow sense it does.
