import React from 'react'

const NotFoundPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Sorry, but there is nothing here!</h1>

    <p>I mean this page is here, but this is not what you where looking for.</p>

    <p>Maybe there was something else here before… who knows?</p>

    <p>Maybe in another universe.</p>

    <p>Like in a multiverse or meta-universe where there exists a hypothetical set
      of possible universes, including the universe in which we live. Together, these
      universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter,
      energy, physical laws and this page.</p>

    <p>Yeah, maybe in another universe, this page still exists. But not in this one.</p>

    <p>If you can, go and travel to another universe and find this page with the
      content you where looking for or you can just browse other pages with the things
      I’ve done.</p>

    <p>Anyway…</p>

    <p>Here is what everyone expects:</p>

    <h3>ERROR 404</h3>
  </div>
)

export default NotFoundPage
