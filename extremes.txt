A big mistake was to think AI will play out similarly to how the internet's story developed. But the truth is that the internet needed thousands of companies to build infrastructure. AI needs perhaps a dozen. The internet required distributed infrastructure because value creation was distributed: millions of websites, thousands of services. AI concentrates value because only a very small number of companies globally can afford and know how to do frontier model training.",["$","br",null,{}],["$","br",null,{}],"Part of this has to do with the dynamics of how AI is built and the reality of what models effectively do to the economy they sit in.

SpaceX's advantage is not just knowing how systems connect. It's having the institutional memory of 10,000 failed experiments that no competitor can replicate. Every custom component represents hundreds of iterations that taught them something essential. When Blue Origin buys off-the-shelf components, they're buying someone else's assumptions. SpaceX's value lies in knowing why each bolt matters, how each system interlocks, and having the capability to go arbitrarily deep when needed.

It's organizational knowledge and custom infrastructure that lets you test the right ideas in minutes, not months, and iterate furiously. IOW, organizational knowledge is the product. The speed of iteration is the moat. The gap between discovery and deployment collapses when your research directly becomes your product.

While at a superficial level these are interesting, if they are critical we will tend to build our own. I think most labs think very similary.
