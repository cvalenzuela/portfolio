Chile has a government purchasing system called "Convenio Marco".
This system seeks to generate savings in the management so that those goods that appear in a digital catalog, which have already been awarded in a tender, should not be tendered again whenever a public entity requires it, but are purchased easily and directly through the catalog.

In this catalog, there are also specific categories to classify the goods offered. This visualization aims to explore where do most companies that sell to the Chilean Government came from and what type of things do they sell.

This project was built using [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/), [Tippecanoe](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe), [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) and Node js.  

This project is in Spanish. You can see it [here](http://dondechilecompra.cvalenzuelab.com).

### By Region
In this images, the green dots represents the suppliers and the pink dots the Government Agencies, the buyers.

By viewing purchases with a regional filter, Chile's centralism around Santiago, seems to appear at first.

### By Category
A category filter shows more interesting patterns. Media advertising seems to be more of a regional purchase for government agencies. This seems logical because regional agencies will want to appear more in regional newspapers and media outlets. Purchases related to airplane tickets reflects Chile's small concentration of airlines companies in Santiago. But purchases related to tourism reflect that most of those spendings are outside Santiago.
