description: "Chile has a government purchasing system called “Convenio Marco”. This system seeks to generate savings in the management so that those goods that appear in a digital catalog, which have already been awarded in a tender, should not be tendered again. This visualization aims to explore where do most companies that sell to the Chilean Government came from and what type of things do they sell."

### By Category
A category filter shows more interesting patterns. Media advertising seems to be more of a regional purchase for government agencies. This seems logical because regional agencies will want to appear more in regional newspapers and media outlets. Purchases related to airplane tickets reflects Chile's small concentration of airlines companies in Santiago. But purchases related to tourism reflect that most of those spendings are outside Santiago.
