description: "Mappa is a javascript library to facilitate work between p5 and existing map libraries and APIs. It provides a set of tools for working with static maps, interactive tile maps and geo-data among other tools useful when building geolocation-based visual representations. Although Mappa was originally designed for p5.js, it can also be used with other libraries that use the canvas element as the render object."
