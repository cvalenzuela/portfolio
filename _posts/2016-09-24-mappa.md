description: "Mappa is a javascript library to facilitate work between p5 and existing map libraries and APIs. It provides a set of tools for working with static maps, interactive tile maps and geo-data among other tools useful when building geolocation-based visual representations. Although Mappa was originally designed for p5.js, it can also be used with other libraries that use the canvas element as the render object. Made for Google Summer of Code 2017"
