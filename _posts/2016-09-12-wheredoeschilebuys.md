description: "Chile has a government purchasing system called “Convenio Marco”. This system seeks to generate savings in the management so that those goods that appear in a digital catalog, which have already been awarded in a tender, should not be tendered again. This visualization aims to explore where do most companies that sell to the Chilean Government came from and what type of things do they sell."
