For three and a half years I worked at [Idemax, a design and innovation consulting](http://www.idemax.cl/) firm based in Santiago Chile.

I worked with a wide range of companies designing, leading and managing innovation and consulting projects in healthcare, energy, food,
technology and finance industries.

We developed technology projects, applications and services around ubiquitous energy, quantified self, savings, better banking, education and Pension funds.

Althougt I'm not able to show most of the work I did there, here are some of the companies I worked with: [Chilectra](https://www.eneldistribucion.cl/), [BCI](https://www.bci.cl/personas), [Cuprum AFP](https://nuevo.cuprum.cl/), [Sistema B](http://www.sistemab.org/), [Bioos](http://bioos.cl/), [Masa](http://www.grupomasa.cl/), [Metrogas](http://www.metrogas.cl/), [Agrosuper](http://www.agrosuper.com/en/), [Tinker Trak](http://tinkertrak.cl/)

And here is the last big project I worked on: [Chispers](http://www.chispers.cl)
