### Ahorra tu vuelto {Save your Spare Change}

In 2009 I developed a system that allowed people to save everyday spare change automatically into their bank accounts. Originally developed for low income communities, this project seek to generate incremental savings using transactions with or without debit/credit cards. During December of 2009, I implemented this project in Chilean's public bank, [Banco Estado](http://www.bancoestado.cl). The idea was first developed for the 2009 Stanford University Global Entrepreneurship Week Contest and won the first place in Chile.
